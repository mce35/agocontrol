" VIM modelines which shall be used when editing all Agocontrol files.
" Ref: http://wiki.agocontrol.com/index.php/CodingConventions
"
" Please ensure your editor uses these, by either:
"   - Installing the localvimrc plugin:
"     http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=441
"
"   - Copying these settings to your own .vimrc, in full or via AutoBuf cmd
"
"   - NOT by adding modelines
"   - NOT by ignoring them.. :) 
"
"
" If you use the localvimrc plugin, you might want to add this line to your
" main .vimc:
"
"   let g:localvimrc_whitelist='/home/youruser/agocontrol/'

" Note that this file only controls indentation and basic code formatting
" For coloring and other statements, please put those directives in your
" private .vimrc.
