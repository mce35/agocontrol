Building instructions for Blockly
=================================

To build an updated Blockly extension, you need to checkout the Blockly
sources, copy a few files, then use their build script and copy the generated
files back to Agocontrol.

You need to specify an external workdir we're building blockly from, and point
to where you have checked out the agocontrol source.

	export WRK=/home/$USER/blocklybuild AGO=/home/$USER/agocontrol

Then, you may run the simple setup.sh script (in this dir)

	./setup.sh

This script is only needed to be run the first time (or if any changes has
occured..). It is safe to run repeatedly.

Now we are fully prepared, and can start the build:

	cd $WRK
	python build.py

You now copy the generated files back to agocontrol:

	./copy-build.sh

All done!
